My first programming challenge: Automated Tic-Tac-Toe

The completed project can be seen [here].

***
Implement an automated version of tic-tac-toe. Your program can assign random moves for X and O or you can implement some AI to favor one over the other. When the X side or the O side wins print out the board and who won. If the game is going to be a draw print out the board and print out that it will be a draw.
 
Based on these conditions your program should never print out a full board unless the final move is a game winning move. If a game is going to end in a draw just print out the board. The program should run until X or O has won 10 games, and then finally output the amount of time it took to run the simulation.
